# Artificial Vision Projects

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ericpts/artificial_vision.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ericpts/artificial_vision)

These are my projects for the Artificial Intelligence Unibuc-FMI course.

## Building

Run `setup.sh` and then `python3 generate_all_pdfs.py`.
The latter command will generate a `project$N.pdf` file in the project root for every project within.

## General Information
Each project has its' own subdirectory, with two main points: `main.py` and `generate_pdf.py`.

`main.py` is the core of the project, doing the actual transformations, and `generate_pdf.py` is used to generate a pdf with the results (how images look originally, and how the transformations affected them).

For each project details are available on moodle, and I have provided just the data part of them so that the repo has everything it needs to generate the final results.
