# Artificial Vision Projects

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ericpts/artificial_vision.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ericpts/artificial_vision)

These are my projects for the Artificial Intelligence Unibuc-FMI course.

## Building
Run `setup.sh` and then `python3 generate_all_pdfs.py`.

## General Information
Each project has its' own subdirectory.
The project details are available on moodle, and I have provided just the data part of them so that the repo has everything it needs to generate the final results.
