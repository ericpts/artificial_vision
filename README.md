# Artificial Vision Projects

## Information
Each project has its' own subdirectory.
You should download the `ProjectX.zip` and unzip it in corresponding directory, so that `generate_pdf.py` will work with the defaults.

Alternatively, unzip it somewhere else and look to `generate_pdf.py --help` for how to give the correct paths.
